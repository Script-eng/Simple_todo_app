# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do application built using ASP.NET Core MVC, following the official Microsoft ASP.NET Core tutorial.

## Features

- Add tasks to a to-do list
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks from the list

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6 or higher
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with C# extension)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Script-eng/Simple_todo_app.git
   cd todo-app


### Running the Application

Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred code editor.
Run the application with the following command:
 - dotnet run
Navigate to https://localhost:5001 (or the URL specified in the console) to see the app in action.

### How It Works

The application uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
The "To-Do" items are stored in memory (in a List), so the data will not persist between application restarts.
The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.
